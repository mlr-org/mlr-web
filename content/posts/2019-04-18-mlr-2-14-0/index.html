<p>The last <em>mlr</em> release was in August 2018 - so it was definitely time for a new release after around 9 months of development!</p>
<p>The NEWS file can be found directly <a href="https://mlr.mlr-org.com/news/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we highlight some of the new implementations that come along with this release of v2.14.0</p>
<div id="filters" class="section level2">
<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>We integrated the filter methods from the <em>praznik</em> package. These were quite few:</p>
<ul>
<li>praznik_JMI</li>
<li>praznik_DISR</li>
<li>praznik_JMIM</li>
<li>praznik_MIM</li>
<li>praznik_NJMIM</li>
<li>praznik_MRMR</li>
<li>praznik_CMIM</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a long awaited PR that we finally merged was the inclusion of the <em>FSelectorRcpp</em> filters.
These are around 100 times faster than the Java-driven ones from the <em>FSelector</em> package.</p>
<p>In addition, we are now using a consistent naming scheme for the filters following <code>&lt;package-name&gt;_&lt;filter-name&gt;</code>.
This change might break your existing code if you used <em>mlr</em> filters before.
However, since it is just a naming change we think the burden of updating your code is acceptable.</p>

<div id="learners" class="section level2">
<h2>Learners</h2>
<p>Two new learners were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>classif.liquidSVM</li>
<li>regr.liquidSVM</li>
</ul>
<p>Learner <code>regr.h2o.gbm</code> now uses “h2o.use.data.table” = TRUE` by default which should result in a runtime increase.</p>
<p>Also, it is now possible to retrieve the feature importance of h2O learners.</p>
</div>
<div id="resampling" class="section level2">
<h2>Resampling</h2>
<p>You can now provide fully predefined indices in resampling.
This is useful for datasets that have a certain grouping structure (e.g. spatial data) to maintain this grouping.</p>
</div>
<div id="mlr-org-news" class="section level2">
<h2>mlr-org NEWS</h2>
<p>You might be wondering what we’ve been up to in the last months in our group.
The major project that we started was <a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3">mlr3</a>.
This is a clean rewrite of <em>mlr</em> with the concept of a modular structure aiming to simplify usage and maintenance of the “mlr idea” in the future, both for users and developers.
We are not completely finished yet but you can take a look at the Github repo what we have achieved so far.
Once we are ready to release the initial version, we will of course write a dedicated post about it.</p>
<p>Putting a lot of time into <em>mlr3</em> also lead to the fact of having less time for responding to issues and questions in <em>mlr</em>.
We would like to apologize for this.
All of us are working in academia and are not getting paid for <em>mlr</em>.
So our resources are limited to some extent.
We very welcome anyone that would like to help us and get involved into <em>mlr</em> or <em>mlr3</em>.
Our team is not a closed group and anyone can contribute to the mlr-org projects.</p>
<p>This fact also lead to the most recent maintainer change of <em>mlr</em>.
As <a href="https://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/">Bernd Bischl</a> (the creator and maintainer) of <em>mlr</em> has a lot of duties, we decided to make <a href="http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~larsko/">Lars Kotthoff</a> and <a href="https://pjs-web.de/">Patrick Schratz</a> the new maintainers of the <em>mlr</em> package.</p>
<p>Due to the existence of <em>mlr3</em>, most development will go there and <em>mlr</em> is aimed to receive only bug fixes and some clean up in the near future.
Right now, we have over 400 issues and 30 pull requests so there is a still a lot to do :)</p>

<div id="roadmap-for-mlr" class="section level2">
<h2>Roadmap for mlr</h2>
<p>We are aiming at publishing new releases every three months from now on, regardless of the amount of changes.
<em>mlr</em> will continue to exist next to <em>mlr3</em> and receive bug fixes.
If users start contributing new features we are also happy to include those into the package.
As announced already, we aim at cleaning up the <em>mlr</em> repo issue and pull request wise in the next months to be able to fully concentrate on <em>mlr3</em> after its initial release.</p>
