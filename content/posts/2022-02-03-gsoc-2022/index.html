<p>Our Org is currently thinking about participating in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC 2022</a> again.
We are considering which projects to propose and would also like to collect input.
This year’s Google Summer of Code is not only directed at students but at a broader audience of people new to FOSS.</p>
<p>We have thought about the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3multioutput">mlr3multioutput</a>
We would like for mlr3multioutput to include multi-label and general
multi-output techniques, such as learners and prediction post-processing methods.
Furthermore, some work on the evaluation of multi-output methods could drastically improve the package’s utility.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3fairness">mlr3fairness</a>
by now contains the basic infrastructure to audit algorithms for some notions of fairness.
We’d like to augment mlr3fairness with several bias mitigation techniques, as well as other notions of fairness.</p></li>
<li><p>Queue-based asynchronous parallelization for R
mlr3 currently heavily relies on <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future">future</a> for parallelization.
Some tuning methods would profit from a different take on parallelization, where task queues are cleanly orchestrated on a central server.
The goal of this project would be to develop a general-purpose parallelization package (maybe extending the future framework) for asynchronous parallelization and parallel programming.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel like one of the projects sparks your interest, feel free to get in contact with us (<a href="mailto:mlr-org@stat.uni-muenchen.de" class="email">mlr-org@stat.uni-muenchen.de</a>)!
Similarly, if you would like to <strong>propose your own idea/project</strong> also get in contact with us, and we will figure out if this is a fit for our organization!</p>
