<p>We at mlr are currently deciding on a new logo, and in the spirit of open-source, we would like to involve the community in the voting process!</p>
<p>You can vote for your favorite logo on <a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/issues/1684">GitHub</a> by reacting to the logo with a +1.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://dribbble.com/hratkin">Hannah Atkin</a> for designing the logos!</p>
