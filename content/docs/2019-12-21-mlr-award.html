<p>We’re extremely proud to have received the Open Source Machine Learning Project Award at <a href="https://odsc.com/california/">ODSC West 2019</a>.
We were joined by <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">Tensorflow</a>, <a href="https://www.datakind.org/">DataKind</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">SHAP</a>, which also received awards.</p>
<p>The ODSC awards recognize projects that have made sustained contributions to open data science.
The mlr project has been active for more than 8 years now, being sustained by the contributions of individual volunteers.
We are especially honored to have been recognized like this as the other awarded projects are coordinated and run by companies with paid staff – this speaks to the dedication of everybody who has made mlr possible.</p>
<p>Lars Kotthoff received the award on behalf of the entire mlr team; you can find his presentation slides giving more background on the project <a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr-outreach/blob/master/2019_odsc/award-talk.pdf">here</a>.
After the award talk, Martin Binder gave a tutorial on mlr3.
You can find his slides and materials <a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr-outreach/tree/master/2019_odsc">here</a>.</p>
